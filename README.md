# Hey, I'm Hidayah, but I also go by Hazel "\(^-^)/"

I'm a Computer Science student at NUS with a growing passion for UI/UX, design and building stuff that actually make life easier/increase quality of life. I used to study Mass Communication at Ngee Ann Polytechnic so most of my time now has been dedicated to beating imposter syndrome!

> Always keen to meet more nerds in tech, designers and devs 


Thanks for stopping by xoxo 🖤
