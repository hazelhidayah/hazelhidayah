# Hey, I'm Hidayah, but I also go by Hazel "\(^-^)/"

I'm a Computer Science student at NUS with a growing passion for UI/UX, design and building stuff that actually make life easier/increase quality of life. I used to study Mass Communication at Ngee Ann Polytechnic so most of my time now has been dedicated to beating imposter syndrome! 

Currently learning how to:
- Make interfaces that don't make people wanna throw a fit
- Design smarter, better, faster, etc.
- Juggle between living life + having fun and learning + staying on the grind

Things I like working on:
- UI/UX design that balances aesthetic and logic  
- Projects that help people — especially my girlies out there
- Upping my chess.com elo (it's bad, don't ask)

Tech I’m using lately:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python for ML & data stuff
- React (slowly but surely)
- MySQL & other nonsense for backend

> Open to learning anything (especially without a time constrain).

> Always keen to meet more nerds in tech, designers and devs who care and share~


Thanks for stopping by xoxo 🖤
